<p>
This project focuses on collecting spontaneous (unscripted) speech data for the Tashlhiyt language using the
<a href="https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en">Mozilla Common Voice</a> platform. The objective is to build a dataset of natural speech recordings that can support research and development in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) for Tashlhiyt, a low-resource Amazigh language.
</p>

<p>
The initiative relies on community participation and crowdsourcing to gather diverse, real-world speech samples, contributing both to language preservation and to the creation of open resources for computational linguistics and speech technology. The proposal and coordination of this effort were initiated through a dedicated issue on the Common Voice GitHub repository
(<a href="https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/issues/5116">see GitHub issue #5116</a>).
</p>

<p>
To contribute, users can visit the Common Voice website, select the <em>Spontaneous Speech</em> task, and choose the Tashlhiyt language, listed as <em>Tashlhiyt (EN)</em> or <em>Tachelhit / Chleuh (FR)</em>.
</p>

<p>
For contributors who may find the standard Latin-based writing used in some questions challenging,
we provide a dedicated <a href="/projects/help/">help guide</a>. This guide explains the writing system,
offers a phoneme reference table, and includes translations to make the questions easier to understand
before recording spontaneous responses.
